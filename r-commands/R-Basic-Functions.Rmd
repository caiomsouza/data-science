In this example we will see how to create a Function in R:

```{r}

setwd("~/git/github.com/data-science/r-commands")


# An example of a Function in R
your.test.function <- function(x, y) {
  
  sum = y + x
  return(sum)
  
} 

# Call your function and pass x and y to the function
sum <- your.test.function(4,2)

# print the result of sum
sum

```
